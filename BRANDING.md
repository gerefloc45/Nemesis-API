## 📝 Project Description

### Short Version (1-2 lines)
**VoidAPI** is a powerful, modular AI framework for Minecraft Fabric mods that enables developers to create sophisticated entity behaviors using behavior trees, perception systems, and utility-based AI - no gameplay content, just pure API.

### Medium Version (1 paragraph)
**VoidAPI** provides a complete AI development framework for Minecraft 1.21.1 Fabric, offering behavior trees, blackboard memory, sensors, and perception systems. Designed as a pure library mod, it contains zero gameplay content - instead focusing on providing robust, modular tools for modders to build advanced entity AI. Whether you're creating intelligent bosses, smart NPCs, or reactive companions, VoidAPI delivers the building blocks you need without imposing any gameplay changes.

### Long Version (Full description)
**VoidAPI** is a comprehensive artificial intelligence framework designed specifically for Minecraft Fabric mod development. Built on modern AI architecture patterns including hierarchical behavior trees, utility-based decision making, and perception systems, VoidAPI empowers mod developers to create sophisticated, dynamic entity behaviors without starting from scratch.

As a pure library mod, VoidAPI contains no entities, items, blocks, or gameplay mechanics - it exists solely to provide a robust, well-documented API for AI development. This design philosophy ensures maximum compatibility with other mods and gives developers complete creative freedom.

The framework features:
- **Behavior Trees** with advanced nodes (Selector, Sequence, Parallel, Cooldown, etc.)
- **Blackboard Memory** for per-entity data storage
- **Perception System** with multiple sensor types (Entity, Block, Sound)
- **Utility AI** for score-based decision making
- **Async Operations** for non-blocking computations
- **Automatic Ticking** integrated with Fabric's event system

Perfect for creating intelligent bosses, reactive NPCs, smart companions, context-aware mobs, and any entity requiring advanced AI behavior. VoidAPI handles the complex AI infrastructure so you can focus on making your entities unique.
